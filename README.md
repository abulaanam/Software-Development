# Software-Testing

This branch contains code examples and tests that demonstrate different types of software testing,
including unit testing, integration testing, and end-to-end testing. Each test is designed to ensure that the code
behaves correctly and meets the expected requirements.It also demonstrates SOLID principles of object-oriented design.
